Class 3: Newtonian Gravity

Gravity:
    Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation:
        F = Gm1m2/r^2
        where 
            G is the Gravitational constant, and
            A particle with mass m1 will attract another particle with mass m2 and distance r with a force F given by above eq.
        Note: This is a universal attraction. Every particle in the Universe attracts every other particle with this force.
    Gravitational Mass:
        Newton's law of U.G defines the gravitational mass of a body
        A spherical object with mass M creates the same gravitational field as a particle of the same mass M at the sphere's center
    Weak equivalence principle:
        Inertial mass = Gravitational mass
